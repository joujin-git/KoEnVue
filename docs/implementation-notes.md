## Indicator rendering

### Style is hardcoded

Text label (`한` / `En` / `EN`) + `RoundedRect` shape. No style/shape selection is exposed. GDI-based pipeline: DIB section → `RoundRect` → `DrawTextW` → premultiplied alpha post-processing → `UpdateLayeredWindow`.

### CAPS LOCK bars

When CAPS LOCK is toggled on, two vertical bars (reusing the per-state `fg` color) are drawn on the left and right edges of the label, vertically inset by `ScaledBorderRadius` to avoid the rounded corners and horizontally inset by `max(ScaledBorderWidth, CapsLockBarInsetLogicalPx)`.

The right bar has an additional `CapsLockRightCompensationPx = 1` physical-px visual correction. The math is symmetric, but `RoundRect`'s right/bottom-exclusive semantics combined with `DrawTextW` AA weighting and premultiplied alpha compositing make the right gap look 1 px narrower without it.

All three constants (`CapsLockBarWidthLogicalPx`, `CapsLockBarInsetLogicalPx`, `CapsLockRightCompensationPx`) live as `private const` in [Overlay.cs](../App/UI/Overlay.cs) next to `SystemInputGapLogicalPx`. The bars are drawn via `FillRect` with `fg` color inside the existing `hBrush` try/finally block.

See [CAPS LOCK detection](#caps-lock-detection) below for the polling mechanism.

### DT_VCENTER glyph-vs-cell asymmetry fix

`DT_VCENTER` centers the font *cell* (`tmAscent + tmDescent`), not the visible glyph box. Most Korean fonts (맑은 고딕 included) have `tmInternalLeading > tmDescent` — the top of the cell reserves space for Latin diacritics that Korean and ASCII-uppercase glyphs don't use, so the visible glyph midpoint sits below the cell midpoint by `(tmInternalLeading - tmDescent) / 2` physical px. Without correction, "한"/"En"/"EN" labels appear visibly low inside the rounded background.

- **Measurement**: `LayeredOverlayBase.EnsureFont` calls `Gdi32.GetTextMetricsW` once per HFONT creation (after `SelectObject(hFont)` into `_memDC`) and caches `_textVCenterOffsetPx = (tm.tmInternalLeading - tm.tmDescent) / 2`. Gated by the font cache key (family + size + bold + DPI), so it only runs on boot + font/size/weight/DPI changes (~1–2 calls per session)
- **Exposure**: `OverlayMetrics.TextVCenterOffsetPx` (positive = shift textRect up by N physical px)
- **Application**: `Overlay.OnRenderToDib` constructs the textRect as `{ Top = -vOffset, Bottom = h - vOffset }` — height is preserved so `DT_VCENTER` still centers the cell normally inside the shifted rect, and the rect itself moves up so the visible glyph midpoint lands exactly at `h/2`
- **Limitation**: Formula is descender-free. Works for `한`/`En`/`EN` because none have descenders. Adding labels with `g`/`p`/`q` would over-correct and require re-derivation from per-glyph metrics

### GDI handle safety

`Overlay.OnRenderToDib` wraps the two created GDI handles (`hBrush` from `CreateSolidBrush` and the optional `hBorderPen` from `CreatePen`) in nested `try/finally` blocks so `DeleteObject` runs on every exit path. The outer `finally` also restores the NULL_PEN selection on the HDC. The discipline is kept visible because adding a future `throw`/`return` inside the callback must not leak GDI handles.

The stock pen from `GetStockObject(NULL_PEN)` is intentionally NOT deleted — it's a system-owned handle.

### Premultiplied alpha

`UpdateLayeredWindow` with `ULW_ALPHA` requires premultiplied RGB values. GDI output (`RoundRect`/`DrawTextW`) is non-premultiplied, and `DrawTextW` AA edges produce partial alpha pixels, so post-processing is required to multiply each pixel's RGB channels by its alpha.

### DIB is top-down

Negative `biHeight` in the BITMAPINFO so `(0, 0)` is top-left. Keeps the pixel arithmetic in the post-processing loop consistent with GDI's top-left origin.

### DIB / DC creation safety

`LayeredOverlayBase` 생성자는 `CreateCompatibleDC` 반환값이 `IntPtr.Zero`이면 `InvalidOperationException`을 던져 null DC로 후속 GDI 작업이 진행되는 것을 방지한다. `EnsureDib`의 `CreateDIBSection` 호출은 `out IntPtr ppvBits` 로컬 변수로 수신한 뒤 성공 시에만 `_ppvBits` 필드를 갱신한다. 실패 시 기존 유효 비트맵과 `_ppvBits`가 보존되어 해제된 메모리를 참조하는 위험을 제거한다.

### EnsureFont resource safety

`LayeredOverlayBase.EnsureFont` 는 `CreateFontW` 호출 결과를 먼저 검사해 `IntPtr.Zero` 이면 `Logger.Warning(family/size/bold)` + 조기 반환한다. 기존 `_currentFont` 와 캐시 키(`_cachedFontFamily/Size/IsBold/DpiScale`) 는 갱신하지 않아 다음 `EnsureFont` 호출에서 동일 파라미터로 재시도가 가능. 이 순서가 중요한 이유는 **먼저** Dispose 한 뒤 Create 하던 이전 흐름이 실패 시 (1) 이전 유효 폰트를 잃고 (2) 빈 HFONT 가 래핑된 `SafeFontHandle` 이 캐시에 고착되어, `_cachedFont*` 필드가 이미 "현재와 동일" 을 가리키므로 이후 호출이 조기 return 하여 영원히 재진입 없이 렌더가 실패하는 상태에 빠지는 회귀를 막기 위함이다. 성공 경로에서만 `_currentFont?.Dispose() → new SafeFontHandle(hFont, true) → 캐시 키 갱신 → GetTextMetricsW` 순서로 진행. 렌더러 측 3개 호출 지점(`Overlay.OnRenderToDib` 등)은 모두 `if (_currentFont is not null)` 가드를 가지고 있어 실패 경로에서 `_currentFont` 가 null 이거나 이전 값이더라도 크래시 없이 한 프레임을 스킵하고 다음 틱에서 자연 재시도한다.

### Label DIB flip-flop prevention

`_fixedLabelWidth` is cached inside `LayeredOverlayBase` after measuring all three labels (`OverlayStyle.MeasureLabels` tuple) and taking the max. This prevents the DIB from churning in width on state transitions (한→En, En→EN, etc.) because all three labels are computed at the same width.

The per-render skip uses `OverlayStyle` `record struct` value equality — `newStyle == _lastStyle` returns `true` when nothing visible has changed. Because `CapsLockOn` is a field inside the record, toggling it automatically breaks equality and forces a re-render.

`CalculateFixedLabelWidth` also skips its own work via a 7-key measurement cache (`MeasureLabels` tuple + `PaddingXLogicalPx` + `LabelWidthLogicalPx` + `_currentDpiScale` + `_cachedFont{Family,Size,IsBold}`) + `_fixedLabelWidth > 0` guard. Cache hit elides three `GetTextExtentPoint32W` GDI calls, the `Max` reduction, and the downstream `EnsureDib` call — `EnsureResources` has already sized the DIB to `_fixedLabelWidth` before `CalculateFixedLabelWidth` runs, so no additional resize is needed. Invalidation is a single `_cachedLabelDpiScale = 0` write inside `HandleDpiChanged` (forces a DPI-match miss on next call); font-signature mismatch is caught automatically because `EnsureFont` updates `_cachedFont*` before `CalculateFixedLabelWidth` compares them.

## Indicator positioning

### Draggable floating window

The indicator is a separate TOPMOST window, not tied to any foreground window's geometry. `WM_NCHITTEST → HTCAPTION` enables native drag. `WM_ENTERSIZEMOVE` / `WM_EXITSIZEMOVE` track drag lifecycle.

### Drag modifier (drag initiation gate)

`config.drag_modifier` (`DragModifier` enum: `None` / `Ctrl` / `Alt` / `CtrlAlt`) gates whether a left-click on the indicator starts a drag. The gate is purely reactive — `WM_NCHITTEST` itself reads `GetAsyncKeyState(VK_CONTROL / VK_MENU)` at click time and returns either `HTCAPTION` (drag) or `HTCLIENT` (click consumed by overlay, no-op because there is no `WM_LBUTTONDOWN` handler). No timer, no hook, no cached ex-style.

- **None (default)** — `IsDragModifierPressed(None) → true`, so `WM_NCHITTEST` always returns `HTCAPTION`. Every left-click starts (or no-ops as a 0-px) drag. Matches pre-existing behavior.
- **Ctrl / Alt / CtrlAlt** — `IsDragModifierPressed` checks the exact state (`Ctrl` mode requires `Ctrl ∧ ¬Alt` so `Ctrl+Alt` cannot accidentally fire `Ctrl`). Modifier held → `HTCAPTION` (drag). Modifier released → `HTCLIENT`; the click lands on the overlay but is silently dropped because no client-area mouse handler exists.

**Cross-process click-through is not supported.** The overlay renders a translucent chip background (alpha > 0 over most of its rect), so the per-pixel-alpha auto-transparency that layered windows apply to `alpha == 0` regions does not cover the chip. `HTTRANSPARENT` is also insufficient — per Microsoft's `WM_NCHITTEST` documentation, hit-test forwarding via `HTTRANSPARENT` only reaches windows **in the same thread**, not cross-process targets such as Notepad or a browser. Achieving real click-through would require toggling `WS_EX_TRANSPARENT` dynamically based on modifier state, which in turn demands either a 30 Hz `WM_TIMER` poller (steady-state wakeups) or a `WH_KEYBOARD_LL` hook (NativeAOT callback risk, 300 ms per-event OS timeout that silently disables hooks on breach). The cost/complexity was judged not worth the payoff, so the feature is scoped to drag-initiation gating only.

Why just `GetAsyncKeyState` at hit-test time: the check runs only when the OS delivers `WM_NCHITTEST` to the overlay (typically once per click), costs microseconds, has zero steady-state overhead, and cannot get out of sync with the user's real key state. This is the minimum possible implementation for a drag gate — idle cost is literally zero.

Key properties:

- Hot reload of `drag_modifier` costs nothing extra — the next `WM_NCHITTEST` reads the current `_config.DragModifier` and is already accurate. `HandleConfigChanged` and the tray-menu `updateConfig` callback touch no additional state.
- Once a drag begins, Windows enters a modal `WM_ENTERSIZEMOVE` loop with mouse capture. Releasing the modifier mid-drag does not abort the drag — `SetCapture` persists until mouse-up / `WM_EXITSIZEMOVE`.
- `Shift` is reserved for axis-lock during an active drag (see [`LayeredOverlayBase.HandleMoving`](../Core/Windowing/LayeredOverlayBase.cs)) and is not offered as a drag-gate choice.
- Clicks outside the chip's alpha-nonzero pixels (e.g., the sparse corners of a rounded rectangle if the caller configures no padding) are still skipped by the OS due to per-pixel alpha — this is `WS_EX_LAYERED` behavior, unrelated to `drag_modifier`.

UI exposure: tray menu "드래그 활성 키" radio submenu (4 items) and settings dialog combo in the "인디케이터 조작" section.

### Position modes

`config.position_mode` (`PositionMode` enum: `Fixed` / `Window`) selects how the indicator is placed:

- **Fixed** (default) — screen-absolute coordinates. Existing two-tier memory (runtime hwnd + config process-name) is used
- **Window** — relative to the foreground window's DWM visible frame. Only config-level process-name storage is used (no runtime hwnd cache), because coordinates are re-resolved from `window rect + offset` every time

Mode selection is available in the tray menu as a radio submenu ("위치 모드 ▸ 고정 위치 / 창 기준") with `CheckMenuRadioItem`. System input processes (Start Menu, Search) always use the existing fixed-mode logic regardless of the selected mode.

### Two-tier position memory (Fixed mode)

1. **Runtime (`Dictionary<IntPtr, (int, int)>`)** — per-hwnd positions, enables distinguishing multiple windows of the same process (e.g., multiple Notepad/Chrome windows). Lost on restart
2. **Config (`indicator_positions`)** — per-process-name positions, persists across sessions as fallback

Process names are resolved via `WindowProcessInfo.GetProcessName(IntPtr hwnd)`. UWP apps (Settings, Microsoft Store, Calculator, etc.) are hosted by `ApplicationFrameHost.exe` — `GetWindowThreadProcessId` returns the frame host PID, not the actual app. `WindowProcessInfo` detects this and enumerates child windows via `EnumChildWindows` to find a child with a different PID, returning that child's process name (e.g., `"SystemSettings"`, `"WinStore.App"`). This ensures each UWP app gets its own position entry instead of all sharing `"ApplicationFrameHost"`.

On foreground change, lookup order is: runtime hwnd → config process name → default position.

### Window-relative position memory (Window mode)

`config.indicator_positions_relative` stores per-process-name entries as `int[3]`: `[(int)Corner, DeltaX, DeltaY]`. `DeltaX` / `DeltaY` are **logical pixels** (96 DPI baseline), not physical pixels. On foreground change, `GetAppPositionWindow` decodes the array, validates `Corner` via `Enum.IsDefined`, obtains the current window's DWM frame via `Dwmapi.TryGetVisibleFrame`, queries the target monitor's DPI scale via `DpiHelper.GetScale(User32.MonitorFromWindow(hwnd, MONITOR_DEFAULTTONEAREST))`, and resolves absolute coordinates with `Overlay.ResolveRelativePosition(frame, relConfig, dpiScale)`. The resolver multiplies the logical delta by the target monitor's DPI scale (via `DpiHelper.Scale` with `Math.Round`) before adding to the frame corner, so the indicator lands at the same logical-pixel offset from the window corner on every monitor regardless of DPI. Result is clamped to the visible area.

This design naturally handles the "same app, multiple windows" case: a single process-name entry (e.g., `"notepad": [1, -50, 10]`) produces different absolute coordinates for each window because each window has a different rect on screen. No runtime per-hwnd cache is needed.

On drag end, `Overlay.ComputeRelativeFromCurrentPosition(hwndForeground)` computes the nearest of the 4 DWM frame corners by Manhattan distance in physical pixels, then divides by the foreground window's monitor DPI scale to normalize the delta into the 96 DPI logical baseline before storing. This save-time normalization plus the apply-time multiplication keeps the indicator's visual position invariant across monitors with different DPI.

### Window movement tracking (Window mode)

In Window mode, the detection loop (80 ms) tracks `lastWindowFrame` and a `windowMoving` flag for the foreground window. When the DWM frame changes (window being moved/resized), the indicator is hidden (`WM_HIDE_INDICATOR`). When the frame stabilizes (no change for 1 tick ≈ 80 ms), `foregroundChanged` is set to `true`, triggering `WM_POSITION_UPDATED` → position re-resolve → indicator re-shown at the new window-relative position.

The `lastWindowFrame` and `windowMoving` state are reset on foreground window change. System input processes are excluded from this tracking (they have their own shared-HWND rect tracking block).

### Default position

Two nullable config fields store per-mode defaults for apps without a saved position. In both modes `DeltaX` / `DeltaY` are **logical pixels** (96 DPI baseline); the resolver multiplies by the target monitor's DPI scale (`DpiHelper.Scale` with `Math.Round`) before anchoring.

- **Fixed mode**: `config.default_indicator_position` (`DefaultPositionConfig` record) — `Corner` + `DeltaX` + `DeltaY` (logical px) resolved against the **foreground window's monitor work area** via `Overlay.ResolveAnchor(workArea, anchor, dpiScale)` (`dpiScale = DpiHelper.GetScale(hMonitor)`)
- **Window mode**: `config.default_indicator_position_relative` (`RelativePositionConfig` record) — `Corner` + `DeltaX` + `DeltaY` (logical px) resolved against the **foreground window's DWM frame** via `Overlay.ResolveRelativePosition(frame, rel, dpiScale)`

Null fallbacks (hardcoded, also logical px — scaled at apply time):
- Fixed: `DefaultConfig.DefaultIndicatorOffsetX = -200, Y = 10` (top-right of work area, scaled by target-monitor DPI before anchoring)
- Window: `DefaultConfig.DefaultRelativeCorner = TopRight, X = -50, Y = 10` (inside top-right of window, scaled by target-monitor DPI before anchoring)

Multi-monitor / resolution stability: offsets are stored relative to a `Corner` anchor, not as absolute pixel coordinates, and both Fixed-mode default-anchor and Window-mode relative deltas are DPI-normalized to 96 DPI logical pixels. The indicator's visual position relative to the anchor (work area corner for Fixed default, window frame corner for Window) is invariant across monitors of differing DPI scale. See "Window-relative position memory" above for the save/apply math — Fixed-mode default anchor follows the same pattern via `ComputeAnchorFromCurrentPosition` (divide by source monitor scale) and `ResolveAnchor` (multiply by target monitor scale).

Tray menu:
- **"현재 위치로 설정"**: branches on current mode — Fixed calls `Overlay.ComputeAnchorFromCurrentPosition()` (work area corners), Window calls `Overlay.ComputeRelativeFromCurrentPosition(hwndForeground)` (window frame corners). Both use Manhattan distance to pick the nearest corner
- **"초기화"**: resets the current mode's field to null (menu item grayed when already null)

### Off-screen position clamp

`Program.ClampToVisibleArea(x, y)` wraps `GetAppPosition`'s two saved-position tiers (runtime hwnd dict + `config.IndicatorPositions`) before they are returned. Resolves the target monitor via `DpiHelper.GetMonitorFromPoint(x + w/2, y + h/2)` with `MONITOR_DEFAULTTONEAREST` semantics, so a coordinate whose original monitor has been disconnected re-routes to the nearest surviving monitor's work area.

Clamp bounds use `Math.Max(workArea.Left, workArea.Right - w)` as the upper limit so indicators larger than the work area collapse to `Left`/`Top` instead of flipping through `Math.Clamp`'s invalid-range exception.

**Read path — stored value is never rewritten.** `GetAppPositionFixed` clamps only the returned coordinate; `_hwndPositions` / `config.IndicatorPositions` entries retain their original values. Reattaching the original monitor restores the original position on the next lookup. Defends monitor removal / resolution change / DPI change scenarios that would otherwise leave the indicator unreachable.

**Write path — new values are clamped before persistence.** `HandleOverlayDragEnd` (Fixed mode branch) applies `ClampToVisibleArea` to the drag-end coordinate before writing to `_hwndPositions` and `config.IndicatorPositions`. Normal drag produces in-screen coordinates because the OS drag loop keeps the cursor on screen, so this is a no-op in the common case — the guard exists for edge conditions such as monitor unplug mid-drag or work-area reduction between drag start and drag end. Keeps `config.json` free of off-screen coordinates even at these boundaries; does not mutate pre-existing entries (see read-path invariant above). Window mode stores a frame-relative offset and is exempt — its absolute resolution is already clamped at read time.

Path 3 (default position) is not clamped because `GetDefaultPosition` already computes against the live foreground monitor's work area. System input processes bypass this entirely since they already route straight to `GetDefaultPosition`.

### System input process exception

`StartMenuExperienceHost` / `SearchHost` / `SearchApp` (`DefaultConfig.SystemInputProcesses`) are special. TOPMOST z-band cannot rise above these shell UI surfaces, so any saved position that ends up under them becomes unreachable.

- Drag is ignored (position never saved)
- `GetDefaultPosition` places the indicator just above the window's visual top-left corner: `(frame.Left, frame.Top - labelH - DpiHelper.Scale(SystemInputGapLogicalPx, monitorDpiScale))`, clamped to `workArea.Top` — the gap constant is logical px (96 DPI baseline), multiplied by the target monitor's DPI scale so the visual spacing is invariant across monitors
- The "visual" frame is obtained via `Dwmapi.TryGetVisibleFrame` → `DwmGetWindowAttribute(DWMWA_EXTENDED_FRAME_BOUNDS)` to exclude the invisible resize border
- **Full-screen DWM frame guard + cached frame reuse**: CoreWindow hosts (e.g., `StartMenuExperienceHost`) return DWM extended frame bounds covering the entire screen, not the visible panel. When the frame encloses the full work area (`Left ≤ workArea.Left && Top ≤ workArea.Top && Right ≥ workArea.Right && Bottom ≥ workArea.Bottom`), the static `_lastValidSystemInputFrame` cache is consulted — if a recent non-full-screen system input frame exists (typically from `SearchHost`, which always appears before `StartMenuExperienceHost` in the Win11 Start Menu opening sequence), that cached frame is used for positioning. Only when no cached frame is available does the code fall through to the general default position

### Shared-HWND system input rect tracking

Win11 reuses a single HWND (e.g., `SearchHost 0x30254`) for both Start Menu and Search modes, distinguishing them only by rect. `DetectionLoop` caches `lastSystemInputFrame` and treats any DWM frame change on the same HWND as a foreground change, re-posting `WM_POSITION_UPDATED`. `HandlePositionUpdated` has a `sysInput` branch that re-resolves position even when `hwndForeground == _lastForegroundHwnd`, so Start Menu ↔ Search transitions re-anchor the indicator.

### System input ESC-dismissal detection

시스템 입력 프로세스(`StartMenuExperienceHost`, `SearchHost`, `SearchApp`)는 `SystemFilter` 블랙리스트에 의도적으로 포함되지 않으므로(인디케이터를 표시해야 하므로), 이들 UI가 ESC 등으로 닫힐 때 인디를 숨기는 별도 메커니즘이 `DetectionLoop`에 있다. 두 가지 닫힘 패턴이 경험적으로 확인됨:

**(A) HWND 유지 + DWM cloaked — `StartMenuExperienceHost`**
ESC 후 foreground HWND가 수 초간 유지되며 DWM cloaked 상태(`DWMWA_CLOAKED`)가 된다. `DetectionLoop`가 매 틱마다 `Dwmapi.IsCloaked(hwndForeground)`를 확인하여 cloaked이면 `WM_HIDE_INDICATOR`를 보내고 `continue`한다. 이후 OS가 foreground를 이전 앱으로 돌리면 다음 틱에서 정상 표시 경로를 탄다.

**(B) 즉시 foreground 전환 — `SearchHost` / `SearchApp`**
ESC 후 cloaked 없이 foreground가 즉시 다른 앱의 HWND로 변경된다. `leavingSystemInput` 플래그(HWND 변경 시 이전 프로세스명이 시스템 입력인지 확인)가 true이고, 새 foreground가 시스템 입력이 아닌 일반 앱이면 `WM_HIDE_INDICATOR` 후 `continue`한다. `lastHwndForeground`를 갱신하지 않으므로 다음 틱에서 foreground 변경이 재감지되어 새 앱에 인디가 표시된다. 단, 인디가 이미 (A)에 의해 숨겨진 경우에는 `continue`하지 않고 fall-through하여 새 앱에 즉시 표시한다.

시스템 입력 간 전환(시작 메뉴 → 검색)은 (B)에서 제외되어 정상 표시 흐름을 유지한다.

## Drag and snap

### Shift-drag axis constraint

While the `HTCAPTION` system drag loop is running, `HandleMoving` checks `GetAsyncKeyState(VK_SHIFT)` per `WM_MOVING` tick. When held, the dominant axis (larger `|dx|` vs `|dy|` relative to `_dragStart{X,Y}` captured in `BeginDrag`) is locked to the start coordinate by rewriting the RECT's Top/Bottom or Left/Right (width/height preserved).

`HandleMoving` returns `true` when modified; caller writes back via `Marshal.StructureToPtr` and returns `(IntPtr)1` from `WM_MOVING`. DPI check runs with the constrained coordinates so monitor-crossing along the unlocked axis still resizes the indicator correctly. Screen coordinates are absolute, so multi-monitor works without special handling.

Shift can be pressed/released mid-drag — axis flips if the user drags far enough in the opposite direction while holding Shift.

### Snap to windows during drag

`config.SnapToWindows` (default `true`) toggles magnetic edge snapping to nearby top-level windows and the current monitor's work area. Tray menu toggle: `IDM_SNAP_TO_WINDOWS = 4004`.

- **`BeginDrag(bool snapToWindows)`** captures `_dragHotPointX/Y` (cursor offset from window top-left via `GetCursorPos`) and, when enabled, enumerates candidates into `_snapRects` via `User32.EnumWindows` with a `[UnmanagedCallersOnly]` callback
- **Filter**: excludes the overlay itself, non-visible windows, iconic windows, DWM-cloaked windows (`Dwmapi.IsCloaked` wrapping `DWMWA_CLOAKED = 14`), and anything smaller than `SnapMinWindowSizePx = 80`
- **Candidate rect source**: `Dwmapi.TryGetVisibleFrame` — snap aligns with the DWM visible frame, not `GetWindowRect`'s invisible resize border
- **`HandleMoving(ref RECT, style, snapToWindows, snapThresholdPx, snapGapPx)`** picks the smallest X and Y edge-pair distances within `snapThresholdPx = 10` (DPI-scaled) via the private `ApplySnap` helper. Window edge snaps apply a configurable gap (`snapGapPx`, default 2, DPI-scaled) to prevent the indicator from overlapping with the target window's border; screen (work area) edges snap flush with zero gap. Only applied to axes not already locked by Shift
- **`EndDrag`** clears `_snapRects`

### EnumWindows / EnumChildWindows NativeAOT callbacks

Uses `delegate* unmanaged<IntPtr, IntPtr, int>` + `[UnmanagedCallersOnly]` instead of delegate marshaling — consistent with the rest of the project's `[LibraryImport]` style. Return type is `int` (not `bool`) because Win32 `BOOL` is 4 bytes.

`EnumWindows` is used in `LayeredOverlayBase.BeginDrag` for snap candidate collection. `EnumChildWindows` is used in `WindowProcessInfo.ResolveUwpProcessName` to find the actual UWP app process inside an `ApplicationFrameHost` window. The latter uses `[ThreadStatic]` bridge fields (not static fields) because `GetProcessName` is called from both the main thread and the detection thread.

### WM_MOVING drift re-sync

Non-idempotent modifications (like snap) inside `WM_MOVING` accumulate drift because the system uses the previous tick's modified rect as the base for the next tick's cursor delta (`new_rect = prev_modified + cursor_delta`). Without re-sync, a slow drag with snap active pulls the cursor further and further from the indicator.

**Fix**: `HandleMoving` first re-syncs `movingRect` to `(cursor - _dragHotPoint)` via `GetCursorPos()` every tick, making the modification chain idempotent. Shift-drag worked without this fix because it always rewrites to a fixed start coordinate (also idempotent by construction), but snap needed explicit re-sync. `HandleMoving` now always returns `true` since the rect is always overwritten.

### WM_MOVING drag DPI

`HandleMoving` → private `HandleDragDpiChange` detects monitor boundary crossing during drag, re-creates resources at new DPI, and calls `UpdateLayeredWindow` directly (bypassing `_isDragging` guard).

## Animation

### 5-state machine

Hidden → FadingIn → Holding → FadingOut → Idle, plus highlight and slide sub-phases. All transitions driven by `WM_TIMER`.

Timer IDs (injected via `AnimationTimerIds` record so Core stays ID-agnostic):

| Timer | Purpose | Source constant |
|-------|---------|-----------------|
| `Fade` | Fade-in / fade-out frame tick | `DefaultConfig.AnimationFrameMs = 16` (~60 fps) |
| `Hold` | Holding → next phase. OnEvent: FadingOut → Hidden. Always: FadeToIdle (→ IdleOpacity) | OnEvent: `config.EventDisplayDurationMs`, Always: `config.AlwaysIdleTimeoutMs` |
| `Highlight` | IME-change zoom (1.3× → 1.0×) | `config.HighlightDurationMs` |
| `Topmost` | Periodic `ForceTopmost` re-assert | `config.Advanced.ForceTopmostIntervalMs` (default 5000) |
| `Slide` | Ease-out cubic position interpolation | `config.SlideSpeedMs` |

### NonKoreanImeMode Dim

`OverlayAnimator.GetTargetAlpha` applies `DefaultConfig.DimOpacityFactor = 0.5` when the state machine is in the Dim branch. Since Stage 4 this lives inside `OverlayAnimator` and is driven by `OverlayAnimator.SetDimMode(bool)` — the `Animation` facade routes `config.NonKoreanImeMode == Dim && state == NonKorean` into it so Core never sees the enum.

### Slide animation

Ease-out cubic interpolation: `1 - (1 - t)^3` via `TIMER_ID_SLIDE`. All animation timers use `DefaultConfig.AnimationFrameMs = 16 ms` (~60 fps).

### Always mode default

`DisplayMode.Always` — indicator always visible (bright on events, dim at idle). `DisplayMode.OnEvent` available via config for fade-out-after-hold behavior.

Idle dimming is driven by `FadeToIdle()` inside `OverlayAnimator`: Hold timer fires after `AlwaysIdleTimeoutMs` → fade from current alpha to `IdleOpacity` over `FadeOutMs`. On the next event, `TriggerShow` fades back from `IdleOpacity` to `ActiveOpacity` over `FadeInMs`.

### HideOverlay `forceHidden`

System filter and tray toggle off both pass `forceHidden: true` to `Animation.TriggerHide` so Always mode collapses fully instead of sliding into dim-idle. "Hide" from these sources means "actually disappear", distinct from Always-mode idle dimming.

## Detection

### Message pipeline

```
Detection thread (80 ms poll):
  1. Every poll: ResolveForApp + SystemFilter.ShouldHide
     - Filter entry (!lastFiltered → filtered):   WM_HIDE_INDICATOR
     - Filter exit or foreground change:          WM_POSITION_UPDATED(hwndForeground)
  2. IME state change → WM_IME_STATE_CHANGED(ImeState)
  3. Focus change    → WM_FOCUS_CHANGED(hwndFocus)

Main thread:
  WM_POSITION_UPDATED  → If foreground changed OR previously hidden: resolve position + TriggerShow
  WM_IME_STATE_CHANGED → Tray update + TriggerShow
  WM_FOCUS_CHANGED     → TriggerShow
  WM_HIDE_INDICATOR    → Animation.TriggerHide(forceHidden: true) — bypasses Always-mode dim
  WM_MOVING            → Shift axis lock (HandleMoving) + drag-time DPI re-compute
```

### Detection loop resilience

`DetectionLoop`의 while 본문은 `catch (Exception ex) when (ex is Win32Exception or InvalidOperationException or COMException or ArgumentException)` 로 래핑되어 단일 폴링 예외(예: `WindowProcessInfo.GetProcessName` 실패, UAC 전환 중 일시적 `COMException`)가 감지 스레드를 종료시키지 않는다. 로직 버그(`NullReferenceException` 등) 는 이 필터에 걸리지 않아 표면화된다. `Thread.Sleep`은 try 밖에 위치하여 예외 후에도 폴링 간격이 유지된다. `_stopping` 필드는 `volatile`로 선언되어 `OnProcessExit`에서의 쓰기가 감지 스레드에서 즉시 가시적이다.

**지수 백오프 + 중복 로그 스팸 억제**: 예외가 반복되면 `Thread.Sleep(PollIntervalMs + backoffMs)` 의 `backoffMs` 를 매 실패마다 `DefaultConfig.DetectionBackoffStepMs = 200` 씩 누적 (`DetectionBackoffMaxMs = 2000` 상한). 드문 COM apartment 과도기 상황에서 초당 12건의 Warning 이 수십 초간 누적되어 로그 파일을 오염시키던 시나리오를 차단한다. 동일 예외 메시지가 연속 발생하면 첫 발생만 `Logger.Warning` 으로 기록하고 이후는 `Logger.Debug` 로 강등, 새 메시지는 다시 Warning 1회. 성공 tick 이 돌아오면 `backoffMs = 0` 리셋 + "Detection loop recovered after backoff (prev=Nms)" Info 로그. 백오프 상한이 2초로 캡핑되어 있어 최악 경우 `OnProcessExit` 의 `_stopping = true` 신호가 `PollIntervalMs 80ms + backoff 2000ms ≈ 2.08초` 이내 전파된다.

### Foreground change detection

`foregroundChanged` flag triggers focus event independently of `hwndFocus` comparison, fixing the return-to-same-window case after a desktop switch.

### Console host fallback

`hwndFocus == 0` + `ConsoleWindowClass` check → use foreground window as focus target. Console apps don't report focus to AccessibleObjects, so we fall back.

### Position update ordering

Detection loop sends `WM_POSITION_UPDATED` **before** `WM_IME_STATE_CHANGED` / `WM_FOCUS_CHANGED` to ensure `_lastForegroundHwnd` is current when those handlers run.

### Per-poll filter evaluation

`DetectionLoop` evaluates `ResolveForApp + SystemFilter.ShouldHide` every tick (not only on foreground change) and uses a `lastFiltered` flag to suppress duplicate `WM_HIDE_INDICATOR` messages. Fixes the "desktop click → same app return" case where nothing appeared to change but the indicator needed to reappear. Hide message is emitted only on `!lastFiltered → filtered` transitions.

### Modal dialog gate

`DetectionLoop` short-circuits when `ModalDialogLoop.IsActive` **and** the foreground window belongs to our own process: `GetWindowThreadProcessId(hwndForeground, out fgPid); if (ModalDialogLoop.IsActive && fgPid == (uint)Environment.ProcessId) { hide + lastFiltered=true + continue; }`. The three dialogs (`CleanupDialog`, `ScaleInputDialog`, `SettingsDialog`) and `MessageBoxW` are separate top-level windows with distinct HWNDs, so the `_hwndMain`/`_hwndOverlay` self-skip doesn't cover them — without the gate, the detection thread would resolve the dialog HWND as a regular foreground app and emit `WM_POSITION_UPDATED`, making the indicator jump next to the dialog (Window mode) and causing `TriggerShow` renders that interfered with the dialog's focus (delayed ESC dismissal until after the first render settled). The gate unifies OK/Cancel/Esc exit behavior: indicator hides on self-process modal entry, and `lastFiltered=true` forces `foregroundChanged=true` on the first post-modal tick so the original foreground app naturally re-triggers the show. Applies uniformly across `PositionMode` (Fixed/Window) and `DragModifier` (None/Ctrl/Alt/CtrlAlt) combinations.

**Process-ID scoping**: the gate is restricted to *our* process's windows, not "any foreground while a modal is open". If the user Alt+Tabs to another app while a dialog is up (Win32 dialogs are modal to the owner only, not system-wide), the foreground switches to an external process — the gate falls through and the indicator renders on that app as usual. `ModalDialogLoop.ActiveDialog` HWND comparison alone would miss `MessageBoxW` (its HWND is owned by `user32` and unknown to us), so PID comparison is the only robust way to cover custom dialogs + `MessageBoxW` while still allowing external-app rendering. `Environment.ProcessId` is a .NET BCL property — no P/Invoke needed. `GetWindowThreadProcessId` is hoisted above the gate so the following `GUITHREADINFO` path reuses the same `threadId` — one syscall per tick.

**External modals (`MessageBoxW`)**: `Tray` 의 두 경고 대화상자("이미 저장된 위치입니다", "저장된 위치 기록이 없습니다")는 `User32.MessageBoxW` 가 자체 메시지 루프를 돌리므로 `ModalDialogLoop.Run` 을 쓸 수 없다. 대신 `ModalDialogLoop.RunExternal(hwndSentinel, action)` 로 호출 구간만 감싸 `IsActive` 센티넬을 세팅/복원한다. `RunExternal` 은 메시지 펌프나 `EnableWindow` 은 건드리지 않고 감지 스레드 가드만 세우므로, `MessageBoxW` 가 활성인 동안 같은 프로세스 PID 이므로 위 게이트가 발동해 인디케이터가 해당 다이얼로그 근처로 튀는 폴링 부작용이 억제된다. 기존 활성 모달이 있으면 이전 값을 보관 후 finally 에서 복원하여 중첩을 지원한다.

### `wasHidden` re-trigger

`HandlePositionUpdated` treats `!_indicatorVisible` as a signal to re-resolve position and show, even when `hwndForeground == _lastForegroundHwnd`. Complements per-poll filter re-eval: detection thread posts `WM_POSITION_UPDATED` after filter clears, main thread sees the same hwnd but knows the indicator needs to come back.

### Deferred `lastHwndForeground`

Detection loop only updates `lastHwndForeground` **after** `ShouldHide` passes. If filtered (transient condition), the next poll retries the foreground change.

### IME state detection

- `WM_IME_CONTROL` + `IMC_GETOPENSTATUS` / `IMC_GETCONVERSIONMODE`
- `GetKeyboardLayout` LANGID check (for non-Korean IME identification)
- `EVENT_OBJECT_IME_CHANGE` WinEvent hook as supplementary signal

#### Tier 1 pass-through on `openResult = 0`

`ImeStatus.TryTier1` 의 `IMC_GETOPENSTATUS` 결과가 `0` (IME 비활성) 일 때 `ImeState.English` 로 단정하지 않고 `null` 을 돌려 Tier 2 → Tier 3 체인으로 위임한다. 한국어 IME 환경에서는 "IME 비활성 = 영문 입력" 이 맞지만, 비-한국어 로케일(일본어/중국어) 에서도 동일한 `openResult = 0` 이 나오므로 Tier 1 에서 `English` 로 확정하면 Tier 3 의 `GetKeyboardLayout` → langId 기반 `NonKorean` 판별 기회를 완전히 잃는다. 대부분의 비-한국어 IME 연관 창은 `ImmGetContext = 0` 이라 Tier 2 도 null 로 패스-스루되어 Tier 3 가 `langId != LANGID_KOREAN` → `NonKorean` 을 반환한다. 한국어 사용자 경로는 Tier 2 의 `ImmGetConversionStatus` 가 `IME_CMODE_HANGUL = 0` 을 돌려 `English` 를 반환하거나, 연관 컨텍스트가 없는 창에서는 Tier 3 가 `LANGID_KOREAN` → `English` 를 반환해 최종 결과는 기존과 동일. explicit `DetectionMethod.ImeDefault` 경로는 `TryTier1(hwndFocus) ?? ImeState.English` 폴백으로 감싸져 있어 변경 영향 없음.

#### Tier 3 HKL IME device signature gate

`ImeStatus.TryTier3` 는 `langId != LANGID_KOREAN(0x0412)` 를 곧바로 `NonKorean` 으로 분류하지 않고, HKL 상위 니블 `0xE` (IME 디바이스 시그니처, `HKL_IME_DEVICE_MASK = 0xF0000000` / `HKL_IME_DEVICE_SIG = 0xE0000000`) 가 일치할 때만 `NonKorean` 을 반환한다. 콘솔 호스트(`conhost.exe`) 처럼 IME 가 아직 스레드에 붙지 않은 프로세스는 Tier 1 (`ImmGetDefaultIMEWnd`) / Tier 2 (`ImmGetContext`) 가 `null` 로 떨어지고 Tier 3 가 기본 키보드 레이아웃(예: en-US `0x0409_0409` — `langId=0x0409`, 상위 니블 `0x0`) 을 보게 되는데, 이를 `NonKorean` 으로 분류하면 `Animation.TriggerShow` 의 `NonKoreanImeMode.Hide` 가드(기본값) 가 `TriggerHide(forceHidden: true)` 로 인디를 강제 숨김해 "플래시 후 사라짐" 증상을 유발한다. IME 장착 HKL(한글 `0xE001_0412` · 일본어 `0xE001_0411` · 중국어 `0xE00E_0804`) 은 상위 니블이 `0xE` 로 시그니처를 가지므로 이 검사로 구분된다. "IME 미장착 스레드 = IME 미활성" 으로 간주해 `English` 로 폴백 — 한/영 토글 1회 시 한글 IME 가 스레드에 결합되면서 `langId == LANGID_KOREAN` 분기로 안착해 동일 결과에 수렴. 콘솔 호스트 외에도 Emacs/mintty 등 비-네이티브 Win32 창 전반에서 동일 증상 해소.

#### WinEvent hook honors `detection_method`

IME 감지 경로는 두 가지다 — (1) 디텍션 스레드 80ms 폴링 (`DetectionLoop`), (2) 메인 스레드 `EVENT_OBJECT_IME_CHANGE` WinEvent 훅 (`ImeStatus.OnImeChange`). 둘 다 사용자가 `config.json` 의 `"detection_method"` 로 선택한 단일-tier 경로(`ime_default` / `ime_context` / `keyboard_layout`) 를 따라야 하지만, 훅은 `WINEVENT_OUTOFCONTEXT` 콜백이라 `AppConfig` 인스턴스에 직접 접근할 수 없다. 해결: `ImeStatus` 가 `volatile DetectionMethod _detectionMethod` 정적 필드를 보유하고, 메인 스레드가 `RegisterHook(hwndMain, config.DetectionMethod)` 로 초기값 주입 + `UpdateDetectionMethod(config.DetectionMethod)` 로 핫 리로드 갱신(설정 다이얼로그 저장 + `config.json` 외부 편집 + 트레이 메뉴 전환 3경로). `OnImeChange` 가 `Detect(hwndFg, threadId, _detectionMethod)` 3-파라미터 오버로드를 호출해 폴링 경로와 동일한 분기. `volatile` 은 메인 스레드가 쓰고 동일 스레드의 콜백이 읽어 현재 구조에서는 불필요하지만 향후 스레드 변경 방어.

### System filter (9 conditions)

1. Secure desktop (no hwnd)
2. Invisible / minimized window
3. Other virtual desktop
4. Class name blacklist (`Progman`, `WorkerW`, `Shell_TrayWnd`, `Shell_SecondaryTrayWnd`, `XamlExplorerHostIslandWindow_WASDK`, `TopLevelWindowForOverflowXamlIsland`, `ControlCenterWindow` + user-specified) — last two cover the Win11 tray overflow flyout and Quick Settings (`Win+A` / volume / Wi-Fi / battery)
4-b. Owner chain blacklist — walks `GetWindow(GW_OWNER)` up to 5 levels; hides only when owner class is in hide list **and** dialog/owner share the same process. This catches desktop-initiated system dialogs (e.g. Recycle Bin empty confirm: `#32770` owned by `Progman`, both `explorer.exe`) while allowing app-initiated Common File Dialogs (e.g. Notepad Save As: `#32770` owned by `Progman` but process `Notepad` ≠ `explorer`)
5. Process name blacklist (`ShellExperienceHost` + user-specified) — hides taskbar/desktop right-click context menus on Win11 where the popup becomes the foreground window with a null owner chain
6. No focus (`hide_when_no_focus`)
7. Fullscreen exclusive (covers monitor + no `WS_CAPTION`)
8. App blacklist / whitelist (`app_filter_list` + `app_filter_mode`)

**Per-tick 프로세스명 메모이제이션**: `ShouldHide` 본문에 `string? hwndProcess = null; string ResolveHwndProcess() => hwndProcess ??= WindowProcessInfo.GetProcessName(hwnd);` 로컬 클로저를 둔다. 조건 4-b 의 owner 루프(루트까지 최대 5단계 상승)가 각 노드마다 동일 hwnd 의 프로세스명을 재조회하고, 조건 5 직접 비교 + 조건 8 blacklist 조회가 또 한 번 호출하던 중복을 제거 — `GetProcessName` 은 내부적으로 `OpenProcess` + `QueryFullProcessImageNameW` + `Path.GetFileNameWithoutExtension` 체인이라 호출당 NT 핸들 오픈 + 커널 모드 전환이 발생하는 무거운 경로이다. 감지 스레드 80ms 핫패스에서 1 tick 당 평균 3~5회의 P/Invoke 체인을 절감한다. cross-tick 캐시는 불필요 — `DetectionState.LastForegroundProcessName` 이 이미 foreground 전환 레벨의 cross-tick 캐시 역할을 담당하므로, `ResolveHwndProcess` 는 1 tick 내부 국소 최적화 한정이다.

### Lock screen hiding (WTS session notification)

`hide_on_lock_screen` (기본 `true`) 은 **WTS Session Notification** 으로 구현된다. `Program.MainImpl` 이 메인 윈도우 생성 직후 `Wtsapi32.WTSRegisterSessionNotification(_hwndMain, NOTIFY_FOR_THIS_SESSION)` 을 호출해 `WM_WTSSESSION_CHANGE` (0x02B1) 메시지를 받도록 등록하고, `OnProcessExit` 가 `DestroyWindow` 전에 `WTSUnRegisterSessionNotification` 으로 해제한다(wtsapi32 내부 핸들 매핑 누수 방지).

메인 스레드의 `HandleSessionChange(uint wParam)` 가 `WTS_SESSION_LOCK` / `WTS_SESSION_UNLOCK` 두 이벤트만 처리:

- **LOCK**: `volatile bool _sessionLocked = true` 설정 + (HideOnLockScreen 활성 && 인디 표시 중이면) 즉시 `HideOverlay()`
- **UNLOCK**: `_sessionLocked = false` 해제. 별도 show 호출 없음 — 잠금 해제 직후 사용자가 창을 포커스하면 감지 스레드의 foreground-changed 경로가 자연스럽게 인디를 다시 켠다
- 로그오프 / 콘솔 접속 전환 등 그 외 이벤트는 무시

감지 스레드(`ProcessDetectionTick`) 는 진입 직후 `if (_sessionLocked && _config.HideOnLockScreen) { state.LastFiltered = true; return; }` 가드로 한 틱을 통째로 스킵한다. 이유: `SystemFilter` 의 기본 클래스 블랙리스트가 LogonUI 의 창 클래스(`CredentialDialogXamlHost` / `LockAppHost`) 를 포함하지 않아 잠금 화면 동안에도 필터가 뚫려 인디가 다시 표시될 수 있기 때문이다. WTS 이벤트는 LogonUI 보다 **먼저** 도착하므로 이 플래그가 감지 루프를 잠금 구간 동안 확실히 침묵시킨다. `LastFiltered = true` 는 잠금 해제 후 첫 정상 틱이 `foregroundChanged` 판정을 유도하도록 하는 sentinel.

`Wtsapi32` P/Invoke 는 `Core/Native/Wtsapi32.cs` 에 `[LibraryImport]` 로 분리되어 있고 상수 4종 (`NOTIFY_FOR_THIS_SESSION = 0`, `WM_WTSSESSION_CHANGE = 0x02B1`, `WTS_SESSION_LOCK = 0x7`, `WTS_SESSION_UNLOCK = 0x8`) 은 `Core/Native/Win32Types.cs` 의 `Win32Constants` 블록에 있다(P3 매직 숫자 금지).

## CAPS LOCK detection

### Why main thread, not detection thread

`GetKeyState(VK_CAPITAL)` is documented to read the **calling thread's input state**, not the global keyboard state. It's unsafe from the 80 ms detection background thread because that thread doesn't have the right input state attached.

Polling lives on the **main thread** via `WM_TIMER` (`TIMER_ID_CAPS = 6`, 200 ms, `DefaultConfig.CapsLockPollMs`). `Program.HandleCapsLockTimer` diffs against `_lastCapsLockState`, calls `Overlay.SetCapsLock(bool)` on change.

### Hidden-state handling

Conditionally re-invokes `Overlay.UpdateColor(_lastImeState)` only if `_indicatorVisible` so hidden-state transitions update the field without touching GDI.

### Startup initial state

Read twice on startup — once inside `Overlay.Initialize` (so the very first `PrepareResources` render is correct for a user who launched with CAPS LOCK already on) and once in `Program.Main` before `SetTimer` (so the first timer tick sees the same value and does not spuriously re-render).

### Record struct value equality breaks flip-flop guard

`Overlay._capsLockOn` is a `private static bool` field read by `BuildStyle` and flowed to the engine via the 14th field `OverlayStyle.CapsLockOn`. Because `OverlayStyle` is a `record struct`, toggling the bit automatically breaks `newStyle == _lastStyle` equality and forces a re-render.

---

## Config hot reload

### Pipeline

`Settings.Load()` runs through `JsonSettingsManager<T>.Load` which invokes 5 hooks in fixed order:

1. **Deserialize** — reads and deserializes the JSON
2. **`ApplyNullSafetyNet`** (EnsureSubObjects) — guards against null `AppProfiles` / `Advanced` etc. from malformed config
3. **`PostDeserializeFixup`** (MergeWithDefaults) — serializes default `AppConfig` to JSON, overlays user keys, deserializes back. Works around STJ source-gen init-default loss (see [conventions.md](conventions.md#net-10-compatibility-notes))
4. **`Migrate`** — `JsonSettingsManager<T>` 의 pass-through virtual 훅. 현재 단독 사용자 단계라 `AppSettingsManager` 는 override 하지 않으며, 파일에 version 필드도 저장하지 않는다. 향후 공개 배포 전환 시 override 부활 예정
5. **`Validate`** — range clamping and normalization
6. **`ApplyTheme`** — theme preset overlay (if `theme != custom`). 프리셋 적용 시 기존 커스텀 색상을 `custom_backup_*` 필드에 백업하고, `custom` 복귀 시 복원 후 백업 소멸. `updateConfig` 콜백에서도 즉시 실행되어 상세 설정 변경이 앱 재시작 없이 반영됨

### Delete-safe hot reload

`Settings.CheckConfigFileChange` returns early via `File.Exists(_configFilePath)` **before** calling `GetLastWriteTimeUtc`. For a missing file, `File.GetLastWriteTimeUtc` returns the sentinel `1601-01-01` without throwing, which differs from the cached mtime and would trigger a spurious `WM_CONFIG_CHANGED` → `Load()` → silent reset to defaults → next `Save()` overwrites the user's real config when it reappears.

Locking the file to forbid deletion was rejected because atomic-replace editors (VSCode, Notepad++) rely on `delete → rename` during save.

### Atomic save (tmp + rename)

`JsonSettingsFile.WriteAllText` 는 단순 `File.WriteAllText(path, json)` 대신 `path + ".tmp"` 에 전체를 먼저 기록한 뒤 `File.Move(tmpPath, path, overwrite: true)` 로 교체한다. Windows 동일 볼륨에서 `MoveFileExW(MOVEFILE_REPLACE_EXISTING)` 는 원자적 rename 을 보장하므로 쓰기 도중 전원 차단/프로세스 강제 종료/크래시가 발생해도 원본 파일 또는 새 파일 중 하나는 항상 온전한 상태로 남는다 (truncate 된 반쪽 파일 불가능). `CheckConfigFileChange` 의 5 초 mtime 폴링은 타겟 경로 한 곳만 관찰하므로 `.tmp` 파일이 핫 리로드를 유발하지 않으며, 프로세스가 `.tmp` 쓰기 직후·Move 직전에 죽어 잔여물이 남더라도 다음 정상 저장에서 같은 이름에 덮어쓰기 때문에 누적되지 않는다. 원자성은 **동일 볼륨** 에 한정된 보장 — config 파일이 exe 옆에 고정되어 있으므로(§ Config file location) 볼륨을 건너뛸 수 없다.

### Corrupted config spam prevention

`Settings.Load()`'s catch block updates `_lastConfigMtime` to the broken file's mtime even when `LoadFromFile` throws. Without this, the 5-second poll sees `mtime ≠ cached value`, re-posts `WM_CONFIG_CHANGED`, `Load()` fails with the same parse error, and the warning log spams forever.

Catch intentionally does NOT `Save()` — the user's broken file stays on disk so they can inspect and recover manually.

### Auto-create config on first run

`Settings.Load()` writes a freshly constructed default `AppConfig` to disk immediately when the file is missing, rather than deferring creation to the next `Save()`. Ensures the exe-only distribution UX matches expectations — drop the exe, launch, `config.json` materializes next to it on the first run.

### Config file location

Exclusively read from and written to `AppContext.BaseDirectory` (the exe's own folder). **No APPDATA fallback**. P5 (`app.manifest requireAdministrator`) guarantees the exe directory is writable. Complete uninstall is "delete the exe folder" because `koenvue.log` and `config.json` both live next to the exe.

### Self-triggered reload prevention

`_lastConfigMtime` is updated **after** `Settings.Save()` to prevent `WM_CONFIG_CHANGED` from firing on our own writes.

### STJ source-gen init default workaround

`MergeWithDefaults()` serializes a freshly constructed default `AppConfig` to JSON, overlays the user's loaded keys, then deserializes the result. Required because STJ source generation drops `init` defaults for properties absent from JSON under NativeAOT — if the user's `config.json` omits `Opacity`, the deserialized object has `Opacity == 0.0` instead of `0.85`.

`EnsureSubObjects()` remains as null safety net for nested records (`EventTriggers`, `Advanced`) whose default construction can also be lost.

## Tray

### NIF_SHOWTIP

`NOTIFYICON_VERSION_4` (set via `NIM_SETVERSION`) suppresses the standard `szTip` tooltip by default on Windows 7+. Both `NIM_ADD` and `NIM_MODIFY` calls must include `NIF_SHOWTIP` (0x00000080) alongside `NIF_TIP` in `uFlags`. Without `NIF_SHOWTIP`, `szTip` is correctly populated but the shell silently discards it and renders nothing on hover.

### NIM_ADD / NIM_SETVERSION return value check

`NotifyIconManager.Add`는 `Shell_NotifyIconW(NIM_ADD)` 반환값을 확인하여 실패 시 `_added = false`를 유지하고 즉시 반환한다. `NIM_ADD` 성공 후에만 `NIM_SETVERSION`을 호출하며, `NIM_SETVERSION` 실패는 `Logger.Warning`으로 기록하되 `_added = true`는 유지한다 (아이콘 자체는 등록된 상태이므로). 이 가드 덕분에 이후 `Modify` 호출이 등록되지 않은 아이콘에 대해 무한 실패하는 상황을 방지한다.

### WM_CONTEXTMENU (not WM_RBUTTONUP)

`NOTIFYICON_VERSION_4` requires `WM_CONTEXTMENU` for right-click menu — shell grants foreground activation on `WM_CONTEXTMENU`. Handling `WM_RBUTTONUP` instead would result in menu items failing to respond because the tray app doesn't have keyboard focus.

### Tray callback routing

Handled in [Program.cs](../Program.cs) (not `Tray.cs`) because it needs `_indicatorVisible` access for the tray click-action toggle.

### Tray click actions (`tray_click_action`) and `UserHidden` persistence

`HandleTrayCallback` in [Program.cs](../Program.cs) routes `WM_LBUTTONUP` through a switch on `_config.TrayClickAction`:

- `Toggle` (default) → `HandleTrayToggle()` (see below).
- `Settings` → `Tray.OpenConfigFile()` — `ShellExecuteW(0, "open", "notepad.exe", "\"{path}\"", ...)`. Notepad is hard-coded instead of dispatching through the `.json` default handler because typical end-user machines have no `.json` association and the default path triggers Windows' "choose an app" dialog or silent no-op. Notepad ships on every Windows SKU, displays UTF-8 JSON correctly, and its save is picked up by the mtime poller so hot reload still applies after the user edits. `lpParameters` wraps the path in quotes to survive spaces (e.g. `C:\Program Files\...`).
- `None` — no-op.

`HandleTrayToggle` flips `AppConfig.UserHidden`, calls `Settings.Save(_config)` immediately (so the state survives restart), rebuilds the tray icon via `Tray.UpdateState` (to add/remove the strikethrough overlay), and delegates overlay transition to the shared `ApplyUserHiddenTransition(wasHidden, isHidden)` helper:

- `UserHidden: false → true` — invokes `HideOverlay()` (`Animation.TriggerHide(forceHidden: true)` + sets `_indicatorVisible = false`).
- `UserHidden: true → false` — sets `_indicatorVisible = true` + calls `Animation.TriggerShow` with the current foreground app's resolved position so the indicator reappears immediately.

The menu path (`IDM_USER_HIDDEN` → `updateConfig(config with { UserHidden = !config.UserHidden })`) reaches the same helper: the `HandleMenuCommand` lambda in [Program.cs](../Program.cs) captures `wasHidden = _config.UserHidden` before applying `newConfig`, then calls `ApplyUserHiddenTransition` when the bit actually flipped (otherwise falls through to the existing `_indicatorVisible`-based config-changed branch). This ensures the right-click "인디케이터 숨김" toggle produces identical overlay/tray-icon behavior as the left-click toggle, even when `tray_click_action` has been set to `"settings"` or `"none"` (in which case the right-click menu is the only GUI path back from `user_hidden = true`).

Five event handlers gate on `_config.UserHidden` to prevent detection-thread events from re-showing a user-hidden indicator: `HandleImeStateChanged`, `HandleFocusChanged`, `HandlePositionUpdated`, `HandleConfigChanged` (only skips the `TriggerShow` branch — tray icon still rebuilds so a hot-reloaded strikethrough change renders), and `HandleActivateRequest`. The detection thread itself does **not** read `UserHidden` — `_indicatorVisible = false` is sufficient to suppress the `TriggerShow` path in main-thread handlers, and cost of the `_config.UserHidden` check is trivial compared to the `WindowProcessInfo.GetProcessName` P/Invoke chain in the detection tick.

Reset paths: (1) right-click tray → "인디케이터 숨김" menu toggle, (2) left-click tray when `tray_click_action = "toggle"`, (3) delete `config.json` (STJ's default unmapped-member handling reinstates `user_hidden = false`), (4) hand-edit the field — mtime polling reapplies the new config at the next detection event. Persisting the state in config deliberately makes it "sticky" — restart/resume preserves the user's explicit hide intent.

### Tray icon strikethrough (`TrayIcon.DrawStrikeThrough`)

Drawn on top of the existing caret+dot when `config.UserHidden == true`. A single thick horizontal rectangle centered at `iconH / 2`, spanning X from `1` to `iconW - 1` (1-px edge inset on both sides). Thickness `Math.Max(iconH / 4, 3)` — 4 px at 16-px icons, 5 px at 20-px icons. `CreateIcon` resolves a state-keyed `fgHex` (`HangulFg` / `EnglishFg` / `NonKoreanFg`) via `ColorHelper.HexToColorRef` alongside `bgHex` and passes the resulting `fgColor` to both `DrawCaretDot` and `DrawStrikeThrough` — the strikethrough thus always matches the caret+dot color and inherits the theme-author's chosen contrast against the background. `try/finally` GDI cleanup pattern identical between the two draw methods. v0.9.2.4 shipped `DrawDoubleStrikeThrough` (two horizontal lines at `iconH * 1/3` and `iconH * 2/3`, thickness `iconH / 6`) but at 16-px tray size the combined vertical coverage (~6 px of 16 px) overdrew the caret+dot silhouette to the point of visual collapse; v0.9.2.5 traded the two-line symbolism for a single bolder cross-cut that leaves the caret+dot intact above and below. A hardcoded white overlay (same `WhiteColorRef` both draw methods used before) was dropped in the same pass because the `pastel` preset's light backgrounds (`#86EFAC` / `#FDE68A` / `#C4B5FD`) rendered the white strike as low-contrast noise; the theme's own `Fg` (e.g. `#14532D` dark green for pastel-Hangul) is dark on pastel and white on dark presets, so delegating to Fg solves both ends without branching. Gray-fill alternatives were rejected because `NonKoreanBg` defaults (`#6B7280` custom, `#9CA3AF` / `#D1D5DB` / `#374151` presets) already land in gray and would have collided semantically with the non-Korean IME state; pure RGB inversion was rejected because its contrast collapses on mid-gray backgrounds (inversion of `#6B7280` is `#948D7F`, both near L=127).

### Startup task registration & path/delay auto-sync

Registration uses `schtasks /create /xml` with an embedded `<LogonTrigger><Delay>PT15S</Delay></LogonTrigger>` (constant `Tray.StartupTaskDelay`). The 15-second logon delay avoids the "Shell_NotifyIconW NIM_ADD failed" race at boot where the task fires before `explorer.exe` has initialized the tray — the `NIM_ADD` retry timer still recovers if the delay is ever absent, but the delay prevents the warn log line from appearing on every boot. `RegisterStartupTaskWithXml` writes the XML to `%TEMP%\koenvue-task-{pid}.xml` as UTF-16 LE with BOM (the encoding schtasks expects) and deletes it in `finally`.

`Tray.SyncStartupPathAsync()` runs on a background thread immediately after `Tray.Initialize` in `Program.cs`. It:

1. Invokes `schtasks.exe /query /tn ... /xml ONE`
2. Extracts the `<Command>` and `<Delay>` elements with plain string `IndexOf` (no `XmlDocument` — NativeAOT-friendly) via `ExtractTagFromXml`. Manually unescapes `&amp;` / `&quot;` / etc. for `Command` (Delay is raw ISO 8601 so no unescape).
3. Normalizes both paths via `Path.GetFullPath` + `OrdinalIgnoreCase`
4. Re-registers the task via XML if either the stored path differs from `Environment.ProcessPath`, OR the stored `<Delay>` is missing/different from `PT15S` (this also migrates older `/tr`-registered tasks to the new XML form on the next launch)

Handles the "user moved the exe" case: the first boot after a move still misses because Task Scheduler launches the old path, but on the next manual launch the sync runs and subsequent boots pick up the corrected path. `QueryRegisteredTask` wraps `Process.Start` in try/catch so schtasks being absent or non-zero exit is silently ignored.

Menu IDs live in [Tray.cs](../App/UI/Tray.cs) as `private const int IDM_*`. The `IDM_UPDATE_DOWNLOAD = 4008` item + separator are only appended when `_pendingUpdate != null`. Position mode submenu uses `IDM_POSITION_FIXED = 3301` / `IDM_POSITION_WINDOW = 3302` with `CheckMenuRadioItem`. `IDM_USER_HIDDEN = 4009` renders as `MF_CHECKED` when `config.UserHidden == true` — its handler calls `updateConfig(config with { UserHidden = !config.UserHidden })`, and the `Program.HandleMenuCommand` lambda routes the resulting transition through `ApplyUserHiddenTransition` (shared with `HandleTrayToggle`).

### Quick opacity presets (`ApplyQuickOpacity`)

The three opacity presets (진하게/보통/연하게) apply mode-aware config changes via `Tray.ApplyQuickOpacity`. In Always mode, the preset value is written to `ActiveOpacity` and `IdleOpacity` is proportionally scaled (ratio preserved). In OnEvent mode, only `Opacity` is written. The radio check compares against `ActiveOpacity` in Always mode, `Opacity` in OnEvent mode.

### Three-toggle duplication with settings dialog

`SnapToWindows`, `AnimationEnabled`, and `ChangeHighlight` are toggleable from both the tray menu and `SettingsDialog`. The settings dialog drops these three rows to avoid duplication. `SlideAnimation` is deliberately **not** added to the tray because usage frequency is low and keeping the menu short is a UX goal.

The duplication is kept as vertical copy rather than extracted to a helper because `HandleMenuCommand`'s per-field `with`-expression getters/setters can't be mechanically abstracted without a delegate map or reflection (conflicts with NativeAOT + P1).

## Dialogs

All three dialogs (`CleanupDialog`, `ScaleInputDialog`, `SettingsDialog`) share the same modal infrastructure:

- **`ModalDialogLoop.Run(hwndDialog, hwndOwner, ref isClosed)`** — Core helper for the `EnableWindow(owner, false) + while(GetMessageW... IsDialogMessageW(...)) { Translate/Dispatch } + EnableWindow(owner, true)` boilerplate. The `ref bool isClosedFlag` lets each dialog's WndProc signal close from inside `WM_COMMAND`/`WM_CLOSE` without the loop helper knowing the close semantics. When the nested loop consumes `WM_QUIT` (e.g., tray Exit while a dialog is open), it re-posts `PostQuitMessage` so the outer message loop also terminates
- **`ModalDialogLoop.RunExternal(hwndSentinel, action)`** — `IsActive` 가드만 씌우는 경량 변형. `User32.MessageBoxW` 처럼 Win32 가 자체 메시지 루프를 돌려 `Run` 을 쓸 수 없는 외부 모달 구간에 사용한다 (현재 `Tray.ShowPositionError` / `Tray.CleanupPositions` 의 빈 목록 알림). 메시지 펌프 · `EnableWindow` 는 건드리지 않고 감지 스레드의 폴링 사이드-이펙트만 차단한다. 기존 활성 모달이 있으면 스택처럼 이전 값을 보관 후 `finally` 에서 복원
- **`Win32DialogHelper.CreateDialogFont(dpiY) → SafeFontHandle`** — 9 pt 맑은 고딕 with `SafeFontHandle` RAII
- **`Win32DialogHelper.CalculateDialogPosition(hMonitor, w, h, anchor?)`** — `null` anchor = center in work area (Cleanup/Settings pattern); `POINT` anchor = top-left at that point (ScaleInput cursor-anchored pattern). Both paths apply work-area clamping
- **`using var hFont = ...`** declared at the top of each dialog's `Show` method frame before `CreateWindowExW`. The `using` scope covers the full modal loop + `DestroyWindow` so the HFONT cannot be freed while child controls still reference it
- **`[UnmanagedCallersOnly]` WndProc function pointers** private to each file (no NativeAOT export name collision)
- **Tab/Enter/ESC** routed through `IsDialogMessageW`
- **Detection-thread gate**: `DetectionLoop` checks `ModalDialogLoop.IsActive` **and** `GetWindowThreadProcessId(hwndForeground) == Environment.ProcessId` together — suppresses polling side effects only when a modal is up **and** the foreground belongs to our own process. External-app focus while a dialog is open (Alt+Tab) falls through so the indicator renders on that app. See [Detection → Modal dialog gate](#modal-dialog-gate)

### CleanupDialog

Position-mode-agnostic: regardless of the current `position_mode` setting, shows the union of `indicator_positions` (Fixed) and `indicator_positions_relative` (Window) keys. Deletion removes from both dicts simultaneously, so switching modes later won't resurrect deleted entries. Running processes are shown with a "(실행 중)" / "(running)" suffix. Full select/deselect toggle. "저장된 위치 기록이 없습니다" message when empty. When items exceed `DlgMaxVisibleItems` (15), a scrollable viewport child window with `WS_VSCROLL` + mouse wheel support is used — same pattern as `SettingsDialog.Scroll.cs`.

### ScaleInputDialog

Custom scale entry for values outside the 1.0–5.0 integer presets. Spawned at cursor position via `CalculateDialogPosition(POINT anchor)`. EDIT pre-filled via `initialValue.ToString("0.#")` (`"2"` for 2.0, `"2.3"` for 2.3).

Parsing uses `double.TryParse` + `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture`, so `"2.3"` works regardless of OS locale. Validation failure shows a MessageBox then refocuses EDIT with `EM_SETSEL(0, -1)` (select all) for easy re-entry.

`ScaleDlgProc` accepts both `IDC_SCALE_OK || IDOK` and `IDC_SCALE_CANCEL || IDCANCEL` because `IsDialogMessageW` synthesizes `IDOK`/`IDCANCEL` for Enter/ESC.

### SettingsDialog

13 sections of settings (정확한 필드 수는 [SettingsDialog.Fields.cs](../App/UI/Dialogs/SettingsDialog.Fields.cs) 의 `BuildRowDefs` 참조). Split across 3 partial class files:

- **`SettingsDialog.cs`** (modal state, `Show`, `TryCommit`, dialog WndProc)
- **`SettingsDialog.Fields.cs`** (`FieldType` enum, `FieldDef`/`RowDef` records, `BuildRowDefs` 13-section spec, 6 factory methods: `Bool`/`Int`/`Dbl`/`Str`/`ColorField`/`Combo`)
- **`SettingsDialog.Scroll.cs`** (scroll state, `SetupScrollbar`, `ScrollTo`, `ScrollFieldIntoView`, `ResolveVScrollPosition`, viewport WndProc)

`partial class` shares all static state at compile time. No call-site changes — `SettingsDialog.Show(hwndMain, config, updateConfig)` is the same public entry point.

**Scroll implementation**: `ScrollTo` 는 스크롤 델타 `dy = _scrollPos - newPos` 를 계산한 뒤 `SetScrollInfo` 로 썸 위치를 갱신하고, `ScrollWindowEx(viewport, 0, dy, ..., SW_SCROLLCHILDREN | SW_INVALIDATE | SW_ERASE)` 한 번으로 모든 자식을 OS 가 BitBlt 로 이동시킨다. 노출된 띠 영역만 무효화 + 배경 지움 처리되므로, 기존 "N 개 자식에 대한 `SetWindowPos` 루프 + 전체 `InvalidateRect(viewport, null, true)`" 방식 대비 휠 틱당 작업량이 O(N) → O(1) 로 줄어 휠 스크롤 반응성이 크게 향상된다. 뷰포트는 `WS_CLIPCHILDREN` + `WS_EX_COMPOSITED` 조합으로 DWM off-screen 합성을 사용해 스크롤 중 플리커도 없다. 자식 윈도우 크기는 `ScrollWindowEx` 가 보존하므로 COMBOBOX 의 `rowH + ComboDropExtra = 220` 드롭다운 높이는 영향 없음.

`ScrollTo` / `ResolveVScrollPosition` / `CalculateWheelScrollPos` 3조합은 `CleanupDialog` 와 동일해 [Core/Windowing/ScrollableDialogHelper](../Core/Windowing/ScrollableDialogHelper.cs) 로 추출했다. 호출부는 expression-bodied 1-라이너로 축약되고 `WheelLineStep = 3` 상수도 헬퍼에서 소유 (P4 공통모듈 규칙).

**Validation failure handling**: `TryCommit` shows a MessageBox, calls `ScrollFieldIntoView` to bring the offending field into view, refocuses the control, and for EDITs selects all text via `EM_SETSEL`.

**`controlColW` dynamic cap**: capped to `innerContentW - labelColW - colGap` so input boxes never encroach on the vertical scrollbar reserve area — a fixed `controlColW` would get clipped under the scrollbar at the default dialog width. The cap 결과는 `Math.Max(1, ...)` 로 한 번 더 감싸 최소 1px 을 보장한다 — 고배율 DPI + 매우 좁은 다이얼로그 조합에서 우변이 음수가 되면 컨트롤 생성 시 GDI 가 혼란 상태에 빠질 수 있기 때문이다.

**Excludes**: fields already toggleable from the tray menu (opacity, indicator_scale, default_indicator_position, snap_to_windows, animation_enabled, change_highlight, indicator_positions, tray_enabled) and "시작 프로그램 등록" (schtasks 기반 — config 필드 아님), complex collection fields (app_profiles, app_filter_list, system_hide_classes, system_hide_processes), and internal-only fields (overlay_class_name).

### Decimal indicator scale

`config.IndicatorScale` is a `double` in range `[1.0, 5.0]`, rounded to 1 decimal place in `Settings.Validate`. Applied as `(int)Math.Round(baseValue * scale)` to `LabelWidth`, `LabelHeight`, `FontSize`, `LabelBorderRadius`, `BorderWidth`, and `LABEL_PADDING_X` — *before* DPI scaling, so DPI and `IndicatorScale` compose multiplicatively.

Tray menu "크기 ▸" submenu lists 5 integer presets (1배~5배) plus a "직접 지정..." item that opens `ShowScaleInputDialog`. Radio check behavior: `IsIntegerScale(scale)` (tolerance 0.001) places the check on the matching integer preset; otherwise the check moves to "직접 지정..." and the label becomes `I18n.FormatCustomScaleLabel(scale)` (e.g., "직접 지정... (2.3배)") so the user always sees the current non-integer value in the menu.

## Update check

### Why WinHTTP over HttpClient

`Core/Native/WinHttp.cs` hosts 9 `[LibraryImport("winhttp.dll")]` bindings + `SafeWinHttpHandle : SafeHandleZeroOrMinusOneIsInvalid`. `Core/Http/HttpClientLite.cs` wraps them as a single synchronous `GetString` method.

- **WinHTTP path**: ~40 KB NativeAOT publish impact
- **`System.Net.Http.HttpClient` path**: ~2.5 MB (full `System.Net.Http.dll` + dependency chain + reflection-heavy handler pipeline)

For a tray app that makes one HTTP call per boot, the **60× size delta** is decisive.

### Fire-once-per-boot

`UpdateChecker.CheckInBackground` is called exactly once from `Program.MainImpl` after IME hook registration, gated by `config.UpdateCheckEnabled` (default `true`). No periodic polling, no retry on failure, no rate limiting. Re-check requires an app restart.

GitHub's unauthenticated API rate limit is 60/hour per IP, and users who leave the tray app running for days don't need stale notifications — they need a single check at the time they most recently *launched* the app.

### Silent failure

Network error, HTTP non-200, empty body, draft/prerelease skip, or `current >= latest` version compare — all funnel to `Logger.Debug` and nothing else. The user never sees a "couldn't reach GitHub" popup because that would be intrusive for a passive indicator app. **예외**: HTTP 200 응답을 받은 뒤 JSON 파싱에서 실패하는 경로 (`JsonException` / `NotSupportedException` / `ArgumentException`) 는 `Logger.Warning` 으로 승격 — 전송 자체는 성공했으므로 일시적 네트워크 이슈가 아닌 GitHub API 스키마 변동(응답 필드 rename, 새 릴리즈 포맷 도입 등) 가능성이 높고, Debug 로 묻히면 업데이트 체크가 사일런트하게 무력화된 상태를 사용자/개발자가 인지할 방법이 없다.

`HttpClientLite.GetString` returns `null` on any failure. `UpdateChecker.RunCheck`'s catch is narrowed to `JsonException or NotSupportedException or ArgumentException` so logic bugs in version comparison propagate; `HttpClientLite.GetString` keeps a wide `catch (Exception)` because WinHTTP marshalling edge cases can't all be enumerated (single P/Invoke-chain try body).

### Version comparison

`UpdateChecker.NormalizeVersion` strips optional `v`/`V` prefix and semver prerelease/build suffixes (`-beta.1`, `+build.42`) via `ReadOnlySpan<char>`, then `System.Version.TryParse` parses the `N.N.N[.N]` portion. `IsNewer(current, latest)` returns `latestV > currentV`.

Semver prerelease ordering (`1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0`) is intentionally ignored — combined with the `release.Prerelease || release.Draft → skip` filter, prereleases never trigger notifications. This is the right behavior: users on stable releases should not be pinged to upgrade to a beta.

### Thread marshaling

`UpdateChecker.CheckInBackground` spawns a `new Thread { IsBackground = true, Name = "UpdateChecker" }` that calls into `HttpClientLite` (blocking sync I/O). On success, the background thread invokes the caller's `onUpdateFound(UpdateInfo)` callback, which lives in `Program.OnUpdateCheckResult`. That method writes to `Program._pendingUpdate` (a `private static volatile UpdateInfo?` field) and calls `User32.PostMessageW(hwndMain, AppMessages.WM_APP_UPDATE_FOUND, 0, 0)`.

The main thread's WndProc picks up the message and calls `HandleUpdateFound` → `Tray.OnUpdateFound(info)`. Reusing the existing `WM_APP + N` pattern keeps the cross-thread signal path consistent with the detection thread.

### Tray menu injection

`Tray.OnUpdateFound` stores the `UpdateInfo` in a `private static UpdateInfo? _pendingUpdate` field (non-volatile because main thread is the sole accessor after the `WM_APP_UPDATE_FOUND` message crossed the thread boundary).

`Tray.ShowMenu` injects a `MF_STRING` item at the very top of the popup menu (ID `IDM_UPDATE_DOWNLOAD = 4008`, label from `I18n.FormatMenuUpdateAvailable(version)`) followed by a `MF_SEPARATOR`, then falls through to the normal "투명도" submenu. When no update is pending, neither the item nor the separator is appended, so the menu looks exactly as before.

Click handler `OpenUpdatePage` calls `Shell32.ShellExecuteW(0, "open", info.HtmlUrl, null, null, SW_SHOWNORMAL)`. Return ≤ 32 is logged as `Logger.Warning` (per `ShellExecuteW` docs, ≤ 32 means launch failure).

### Why no balloon/toast/tooltip prefix

Three notification surfaces were considered:

1. **Balloon (`NIIF_INFO`)** — rejected as too intrusive for a passive indicator app
2. **Windows 10+ Toast** — requires a registered `AppUserModelID` and a shortcut in the Start menu, which conflicts with the portable single-exe distribution model
3. **Tooltip prefix** ("⚡ Update available — 한글 모드") — rejected as too subtle; clutters the hover hint without being discoverable

The tray menu item is discoverable (user sees it when they right-click to exit or change settings) without being intrusive.

### Config toggle

`AppConfig.UpdateCheckEnabled : bool = true` lives in the `[시스템]` section next to `LogMaxSizeMb`. Not exposed in the tray menu (low-frequency toggle) — users who want to disable it edit `config.json` directly. Adding a row to [SettingsDialog.Fields.cs](../App/UI/Dialogs/SettingsDialog.Fields.cs) is a 3-line addition if needed later.

### End-to-end validation

Against v0.8.9.0 release (2026-04-14), both branches were exercised:

- **"no update"**: `AppVersion = 0.8.9.0` matches release tag, UpdateChecker fires on boot, HTTP 200 + JSON in 47 ms round-trip, `IsNewer` returns false, `Logger.Debug("UpdateChecker: current=0.8.9.0 latest=v0.8.9.0 (no update)")`, tray menu stays unchanged
- **"new version found"**: `AppVersion` temporarily patched to `0.8.8.0`, same run logs `Logger.Info("UpdateChecker: new version available — current=0.8.8.0 latest=v0.8.9.0")`, `_pendingUpdate` populated, `PostMessageW(WM_APP_UPDATE_FOUND)` dispatched, tray menu shows the update item, clicking opens the GitHub release page in the default browser via `ShellExecuteW`

Every link in the chain (`WinHttpSetTimeouts` inheritance, `SafeWinHttpHandle` RAII, JSON source gen, `NormalizeVersion` `v` prefix handling, 4-part `Version.TryParse`, volatile `_pendingUpdate` cross-thread hop, tray menu dynamic injection, `ShellExecuteW` browser launch) confirmed operational.

## Multi-instance and tray recovery

### Mutex ordering — why acquire before cleanup

`Program.MainImpl` 초기화 순서에서 `TryAcquireMutex` 가 `CleanupPreviousTrayIcon` 보다 **먼저** 실행되어야 한다. 두 함수 모두 `DefaultConfig.AppGuid` 와 연관된 상태(Mutex 이름, 트레이 아이콘 GUID)에 작용하므로 순서가 역전되면 두 번째 인스턴스가 이미 실행 중인 정상 인스턴스의 트레이 아이콘을 `NIM_DELETE` 로 지워버린 뒤 Mutex 실패로 종료하는 부작용이 발생한다.

Mutex 획득 성공은 "이전 인스턴스가 존재하지 않는다" 는 보장이므로(크래시 시 OS 가 Mutex 를 자동 해제), 이 조건 하에서만 Cleanup 이 안전하게 "이전 크래시의 유령 아이콘을 정리" 한다는 의미를 가진다.

### Second-instance activation signal

`TryAcquireMutex` 실패 시 `NotifyExistingInstance` 가 호출된다. 메인 윈도우 클래스명(`"KoEnVueMain"`)으로 `User32.FindWindowW` 호출 → 기존 인스턴스의 HWND 를 얻고 `PostMessageW(hwnd, AppMessages.WM_APP_ACTIVATE, 0, 0)`. 두 번째 인스턴스는 즉시 종료한다.

기존 인스턴스의 WndProc 는 `WM_APP_ACTIVATE` (`WM_APP + 7`) 를 수신해 `HandleActivateRequest` 로 분기한다. 여기서 현재 포그라운드 앱 기준 좌표로 `Animation.TriggerShow` 를 호출해 인디케이터를 즉시 표시 — `DisplayMode` 와 `EventTriggers` 설정을 **무시**하고 강제 표시하는 이유는 사용자의 명시적인 재실행 행위에 대한 응답이기 때문.

메시지 전용 윈도우(HWND_MESSAGE parent) 가 아니라 일반 최상위 윈도우(데스크톱 parent + 화면 미표시)로 생성되므로 `FindWindowW` 가 정상 매칭한다. 탐색 실패(기존 창이 막 파괴 중이거나 클래스명이 달라진 경우)는 조용히 무시된다.

### TaskbarCreated — shell restart recovery

셸(`explorer.exe`) 재시작 시 이전에 등록된 모든 트레이 아이콘 정보는 소실된다. Windows 는 이를 보완하기 위해 `"TaskbarCreated"` 라는 이름의 **등록된 윈도우 메시지**를 모든 최상위 창에 브로드캐스트한다. 셸 업데이트, 크래시, 수동 재시작(`taskkill /im explorer.exe` 등) 시나리오에서 모두 발생.

`Program.MainImpl` 은 메인 윈도우 생성 직후 `User32.RegisterWindowMessageW("TaskbarCreated")` 로 메시지 ID 를 받아 `_taskbarCreatedMsgId` 필드에 저장한다. 동적 ID 이므로 WndProc 의 `switch` 에 넣을 수 없어 switch 앞단의 if 분기로 비교한다:

```csharp
if (msg != 0 && msg == _taskbarCreatedMsgId && hwnd == _hwndMain)
{
    HandleTaskbarCreated();
    return IntPtr.Zero;
}
```

`hwnd == _hwndMain` 체크는 오버레이 창도 최상위라 같은 브로드캐스트를 받는 문제를 피하기 위함 — 메인 창에서만 한 번 처리한다.

`HandleTaskbarCreated` 는 `config.TrayEnabled` 확인 후 `Tray.Recreate(_lastImeState, _config)` 를 호출한다. `Recreate` 는 `Remove` (내부 상태 초기화, `NIM_DELETE` 는 셸 측 등록이 없으므로 실패해도 무해) → `Initialize` (`NotifyIconManager` 재생성 + `NIM_ADD` + `NIM_SETVERSION`) 순서로 아이콘을 복구한다.

`RegisterWindowMessageW` 등록 실패(매우 드묾) 시에는 `Logger.Warning` 만 남기고 복구 기능만 비활성화된다 — 앱 자체 동작엔 영향 없음.

---

## Misc

### Delegate GC prevention

Static field retention for P/Invoke callbacks (e.g., `_imeChangeCallback` in [ImeStatus.cs](../App/Detector/ImeStatus.cs)). Without the static reference, the GC would collect the delegate mid-flight and the Win32 call would `AccessViolation`.

### COM init ordering

`Main` 에 `[STAThread]` 를 붙여 CLR 이 메인 스레드를 STA 로 초기화하도록 위임한다 (NativeAOT 도 이 속성을 존중한다). CLR 이 `Main` 진입 전 `CoInitializeEx(COINIT_APARTMENTTHREADED)` 를 부르고 프로세스 종료 시 짝을 맞춰 `CoUninitialize` 도 수행하므로, 앱 코드에서는 별도의 명시적 초기화/해제 호출이 없다.

이전 구조는 `Ole32.CoInitializeEx` 를 앱이 직접 불렀는데, CLR 기본 설정(MTA)과 충돌해 `RPC_E_CHANGED_MODE`(0x80010106) 로 실패하고 VDM / WinEventHook 이 사일런트하게 degrade 되는 버그가 있었다. `[STAThread]` 로 CLR 이 먼저 STA 를 잡아주게 하면 이 경로 전체가 사라진다. 또한 `ProcessExit` 가 finalizer 스레드에서 돌아 `CoUninitialize` 를 메인 스레드 apartment 와 매칭되지 않은 곳에서 부르던 잠재 결함도 함께 제거됐다.

메인 스레드 STA 초기화가 보장된 직후 `SystemFilter.ShouldHide` 를 1회 호출해 static constructor 를 강제 실행하고 `IVirtualDesktopManager` COM 객체를 생성해둔다 — 이후 메인·감지 스레드 양쪽에서 안전하게 사용 가능.

### Overlay window class

Separately registered (shared WndProc with main window). `WM_DESTROY` guard checks `hwnd == _hwndMain` so app exit doesn't trigger when the overlay is destroyed.

### DWMWA constants location

`DWMWA_EXTENDED_FRAME_BOUNDS` and `DWMWA_CLOAKED` live in [Core/Native/Win32Types.cs](../Core/Native/Win32Types.cs) under the `Win32Constants` class rather than inside `Core/Native/Dwmapi.cs`. P4 mandates that all Win32 structs and constants are centralized in `Win32Types.cs` regardless of which DLL they belong to.

### `volatile` + `Action<AppConfig>` callback

`_config` is a `volatile` field, and `ref` cannot be used with volatile, so config updates use an `Action<AppConfig>` callback pattern instead of `ref AppConfig`.

### `OnProcessExit` cleanup sequence

`Program.Bootstrap.OnProcessExit`는 다음 순서로 리소스를 정리한다:

1. `_stopping = true` — 감지 스레드 종료 신호 (volatile)
2. IME 훅 해제 (`ImeStatus.UnregisterHook`)
3. CAPS LOCK 폴링 타이머 명시적 해제 (`KillTimer`)
4. 애니메이션 + 렌더링 리소스 해제 (윈도우 파괴 전)
5. 오버레이 + 메인 윈도우 명시적 파괴 (`DestroyWindow`)
6. 트레이 아이콘 제거 (`NIM_DELETE`)
7. Mutex 해제 (`Dispose` only — `ReleaseMutex`는 소유 스레드에서만 가능하나 `ProcessExit`는 다른 스레드일 수 있음)
8. 종료 로그 기록 + 로거 종료 (`Logger.Info` → `Logger.Shutdown`)

COM 해제는 `[STAThread]` 기반으로 CLR 이 메인 스레드 종료 시 자동 수행하므로 `ProcessExit` 에서는 건드리지 않는다. `ProcessExit` 는 finalizer 스레드에서 돌기 때문에 여기서 `CoUninitialize` 를 불러도 메인 스레드 apartment 와 매칭되지 않는다.

`Logger.Shutdown`은 반드시 마지막에 호출하여 이전 단계의 로그가 모두 기록되도록 보장한다. 타이머 해제와 윈도우 파괴는 리소스 해제(5단계) 이후에 수행하여 타이머 콜백이 해제된 리소스를 참조하는 것을 방지한다.

### `InvariantGlobalization`

Enabled in [KoEnVue.csproj](../KoEnVue.csproj) — strips ICU from the NativeAOT publish. Means no `CultureInfo` usage except for `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture`. IME language detection uses `GetUserDefaultUILanguage` P/Invoke instead of `CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture`.
